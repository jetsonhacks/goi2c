# goi2c
Jetson I2C interface in Go (Golang)
This repository contains some sketches which interface the Jetson Development Kits
with an I2C interface and web servers.

These examples interface with an Adafruit 0.56" 4-Digit 7-Segment Display w/I2C Backpack.
The configuration of the interface will depend on how the I2C Backpack is wired to the the Jetson.
This can be changed in the 'main' function of each example.

The folders:
devices          - holds code for interfacing with the I2C backback 7 segment display
i2c              - I2C interface library, derived from https://github.com/SpaceLeap/go-embedded/blob/master/i2c/i2c.go
i2cExample       - Interface with the Jetson to the 7 Segment Display
i2cExampleServer - A more involved example. Shows digits on the Segment Display, and broadcasts over the Web using Server Side Events (SSE)
                   HTML 5 Browser required.
